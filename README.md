### üìä Elevating Consumer Goods Insights: Unveiling the Power of SQL and Data Visualization üõçÔ∏è
####  Sharing my recent project in the consumer goods domain, where I delved deep into SQL querying, advanced analytics, and dynamic data visualization techniques! Here's a glimpse into the journey:
#### üîç Project Overview: Used MySQL for data querying, Power BI for visualization, and Power Point for presentation to address management's ad hoc requests.
#### üí° Knowledge Gained: Enhanced SQL skills including subqueries, CTEs, JOIN types, and window functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK.
#### üìä Insights Delivered: Uncovered unique product insights, identified top customers, analyzed discount percentages, computed sales amounts, and evaluated total quantities sold.
#### üöÄ Impact and Learnings: Showcased the power of SQL in extracting insights and emphasized the importance of data visualization in communicating findings effectively.
#### üí¨ Key Takeaways: Integrating various tools is crucial for data analysis, emphasizing continuous learning in the evolving data landscape.

## Adhoc Requests

        from gdb023.fact_sales_monthly
        )
    select unique_product_2020,
          unique_product_2021,
          concat(round(((unique_product_2021 - unique_product_2020)/unique_product_2020)*100,2), '%') as percentage_chg

        count(distinct case when fiscal_year = "2021" then s.product_code end) as product_count_2021
        from gdb023.fact_sales_monthly s
        inner join gdb023.dim_product p
        on s.product_code = p.product_code
        group by segment
        )
select segment, product_count_2020, product_count_2021,

```
#### 5) Get the products that have the highest and lowest manufacturing costs. The final output should contain these fields,product_code, product, manufacturing_cost
```
select p.product_code, p.product, concat("$",round(manufacturing_cost,2)) as manufacturing_cost
from gdb023.dim_product p
inner join gdb023.fact_manufacturing_cost m
on p.product_code = m.product_code
where manufacturing_cost = (select max(manufacturing_cost)
from gdb023.fact_manufacturing_cost) 
or manufacturing_cost = (select min(manufacturing_cost)
from gdb023.fact_manufacturing_cost)
order by manufacturing_cost desc;
```
#### 6) Generate a report which contains the top 5 customers who received an average high pre_invoice_discount_pct for the fiscal year 2021 and in the Indian market. The final output contains these fields,customer_code, customer, average_discount_percentage
```
select d.customer_code, c.customer, concat(round(avg(pre_invoice_discount_pct)*100,2),"%") as Avg_discount_percentage

 order by avg(pre_invoice_discount_pct) desc
 limit 5;
```
#### 7) Get the complete report of the Gross sales amount for the customer ‚ÄúAtliq Exclusive‚Äù for each month. This analysis helps to get an idea of low and high-performing months and take strategic decisions. The final report contains these columns: Month, Year, Gross sales Amount
